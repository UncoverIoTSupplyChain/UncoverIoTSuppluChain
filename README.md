# UncoverIoTSuppluChain

## dataset
To facilitate empirical research, we constructed our own dataset in the laboratory. 

## result
### Intro
This folder stores the output results of our measurement process. 
### Folder Introduction
1. The "Original Features" stores the original feature files we extracted from the stream.
2. The "Feature processing" folder stores the feature files after clustering and feature deduplication. The "device" sheet stores the clustering results after we further map the stream to the device dimension. The "device_filter" sheet further filters clusters containing only devices from the same manufacturer based on the device sheet file.
3. The "Feature Clustering Integration" folder stores the output of the feature merging analysis in Section 4.2.1.
4. The "Feature Overlaps Counting" folder stores the relevant results in 4.2.2, mainly including equipment feature cross-index, heat map, and other files.
